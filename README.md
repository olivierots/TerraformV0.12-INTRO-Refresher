===  few useful things about terraform ===
```
# terraform init ==> initialize the folder and pull down all plugins 
# terraform plan ==> checks the state file, compares what's already created & what needs to be
                     created and look for any difference.
# terraform apply ==> create your resource
# terraform destroy ==> delete your resources
# terraform apply -auto-approve ==> no need to approve before resource creation 
# what is a state file ==> most important file in terraform that keeps track of all the changes we make 
# modules ==> a folder with terraform code inside it. helps you to be more organised with each
              resource in different folders which can then be re-used easily
# dependencies ==> Terraform uses dependencies to determine the correct order in
                   which to create the different resourcess
# count ==> helps us create multiple resources e.g multple ec2 instances or s3 buckets
# terraform import ==> used to import existing aws resources into the terrafrom state file
                       e.g terraform import aws_vpc.existingvpc <vpc_id> 
# data source ==> terraform queries aws and return information via an api
                  e.g ami, AZ (it does not set up anything at all)
